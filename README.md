# Data Availability for Anharmonicity and Charge sensitivity of Fraunhofer Gatemon

This repository contains the source code and data supporting the results presented in the paper.

## File Description
* `function.py`: Library containing the tight-binding model and calculations (based on the work of Irfan and Akhmerov).
* `final_fig.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook used to generate the final figures in the paper.
* `anharmonicity_all.csv`: Data file containing tight-binding model calculations.


## Usage
To reproduce the figures, open `final_fig.ipynb` and run all cells. Ensure `function.py` and `anharmonicity_all.csv` are in the same directory.
